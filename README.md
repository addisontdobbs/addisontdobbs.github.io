I built a fully responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on both design and functionality. HTML provided the structural foundation, while CSS handled styling, layout, and responsiveness using flexbox and media queries. JavaScript added interactivity, enabling dynamic elements like animations, toggles, and event-driven behavior. I aimed for a clean and intuitive user experience, ensuring smooth navigation and accessibility across different devices. This project allowed me to refine my front-end development skills and implement modern web design techniques effectively.
